This version of the protocol is compatible with the v1 version of the Emitter contract. Upgrading the protocol is done through the existing Emitter contract by executing a backstop swap.

If a fork of this version of the protocol is desired, a new instance of the v1 Emitter contract can be deployed.

To reference the source code of the v1 Emitter contract, see: https://github.com/blend-capital/blend-contracts/tree/v1.0.0/emitter

To reference the WASM of the v1 Emitter contract, see:
